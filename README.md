# Global Trial Landscape

### Where are clinical trials taking place globally? What can we learn from publicly available resources and automated methods?

Affiliation data is generally non-standardized and unstructured. In this project we are using data from clinical trial registries (such as ClinicalTrials.gov) and PubMed, and applying existing resources such as ROR and OpenAlex to cluster site and sponsor information. We will explore the limitations of these automated methods and supplement with some manual efforts.
